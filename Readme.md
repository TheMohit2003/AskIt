## Project Overview

The AskIt project aims to replicate the core functionalities of Quora, providing users with a platform to ask and answer questions, follow topics and other users, and engage in discussions. We have divided the project into two main components: the frontend and the backend.

- **Frontend**: The frontend is built using [React](https://reactjs.org/). It's responsible for the user interface, including user authentication, question and answer management, user profiles, and more. For detailed information on the frontend, please refer to the [Frontend Team Readme](client/README.md).

- **Backend**: The backend is developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js). It provides a set of APIs for user authentication, question and answer management, real-time updates, and more. For detailed information on the backend, please refer to the [Backend Team Readme](server/README.md).

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to set up and run the AskIt project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
- MongoDB
- Git

### Installing Dependencies

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quora-clone.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the `client` directory (frontend) and install frontend dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

3. Navigate to the `server` directory (backend) and install backend dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd ../server
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the backend server (from the `server` directory):

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Start the frontend development server (from the `client` directory):

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

Your AskIt application should now be running locally. Access it by opening a web browser and navigating to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
