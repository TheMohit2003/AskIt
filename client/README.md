# Frontend Development Project: Quora Clone

## Project Overview:

Create the frontend of a Quora clone using the MERN stack. The frontend is a critical component responsible for providing an intuitive and engaging user experience. This document outlines the project's goals, requirements, and guidelines for the frontend development team.

## Project Goals:

- Create a user-friendly interface for asking and answering questions.
- Implement user authentication and profile management.
- Develop a responsive and visually appealing design.
- Ensure smooth navigation and user interaction.
- Integrate with the backend APIs seamlessly.

## Tech Stack:

- **React**: Use React as the primary JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- **React Router**: Handle client-side routing and navigation within the application.
- **Axios or Fetch**: Make HTTP requests to interact with backend APIs.
- **Styling**: Choose a styling approach, such as CSS, SCSS, or a CSS-in-JS solution (e.g., styled-components).
- **State Management**: Utilize state management libraries like Redux or React Context for managing application state.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the application is responsive for various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Testing**: Implement unit and integration tests using tools like Jest and React Testing Library.
- **Deployment**: Prepare the frontend for deployment on a hosting platform (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).

## Frontend Components and Pages:

### User Authentication:

- Implement registration and login forms.
- Create user profile management pages.
- Handle user authentication flows and error handling.

### Home Page:

- Display a feed of trending questions and topics.
- Implement a search bar for finding questions and topics.
- Allow users to follow topics and explore questions.

### Question Pages:

- Display individual question details along with answers.
- Implement forms for asking and answering questions.
- Add voting and reporting functionality.
- Show related questions and answers.

### User Profile:

- Display user profiles with information and activity.
- Allow users to edit their profiles.
- Show questions and answers posted by the user.
- Implement a follow/unfollow feature for users.

### Notifications:

- Create a notification center for displaying user notifications.
- Mark notifications as read and clear notifications.

### Real-time Updates:

- Integrate real-time updates using WebSockets or a real-time library (e.g., Socket.io).

### Styling:

- Design a clean and visually appealing user interface.
- Ensure a consistent design and user experience across the application.

### Error Handling:

- Implement error handling for API requests and user interactions.
- Provide clear error messages and feedback to users.

## Project Workflow:

- **Version Control**: Use Git for version control, and host the repository on a platform like GitHub or GitLab.
- **Branching Strategy**: Follow a branching strategy (e.g., Gitflow) to manage code changes and collaborate effectively.
- **Code Reviews**: Conduct regular code reviews to maintain code quality and consistency.
- **Testing**: Write tests for critical components and features to catch and fix issues early.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

## Documentation:

- Create detailed documentation for the frontend codebase, including code comments, style guides, and usage instructions for reusable components.
